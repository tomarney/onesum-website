      We've perfected a system that means you only have to pay for the real work: the design and build.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-8">
      By using modern web infrastructure and tools, our websites are virtually <strong class="font-medium">maintenance-free <em>and</em> secure</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-8">
      <strong class="font-medium">We hand-code each website carefully</strong>. The result is a modern, beautiful website that's so small and light that it <strong class="font-medium">costs nothing to run</strong>. The only thing you pay for is the domain name.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-8">
      Works for everyone: the websites we make work on everything from a tiny phone screen to a 4K monitor, from a sketchy mobile connection on the train to ultra-fast fibre broadband. <strong class="font-medium">Whoever, wherever and whenever someone visits your site, it'll work for them</strong>. Now and for years to come, with no updates necessary.
